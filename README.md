 ## Ansible first steps:

* Requirement for ansible control machine:
**Python 2** (versions 2.6 or 2.7) or **Python 3** (versions 3.5 and higher) installed (**Windows isn’t supported** for the control machine)

* Ansible installation:
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html

* Checking path to config file:
```
ansible --version
```

* Before start work uncomment in **ansible.cfg**:
```
host_key_checking=False
log_path=/appserver/ansible/logs/ansible.log
```

* To add hosts to inventory - file hosts could be used. Save default file under hosts.old. After that you could add hosts to newly created emty hosts file:
```
mv hosts hosts.old && touch hosts
```
* After adding hosts to hosts file. Connection could be checked with ansinle ping. User - user used for servers, assuming that all servers had the same `user` user. After that password for this user will be required (assume that all users have the same password):
```
 ansible all -m ping -u user -k
 ```

* To set up passwordless autorization beetween control host and controlled hosts:
1. On control machine (under user, which would run playbooks) generate ssh-key with command:
```
ssh-keygen
```
2. After that playbook **authorized_key.ym** could be used for setting up passwordless autorization with command:
```
ansible-playbook authorized_key.yml -e user=someuser -k
```
After correct SSH password input and successful run of playbook next run of any playbook for inventory hosts will be without password (-k option).
